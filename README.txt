The project idea for HackBeanpot 2023:
A program that visualizes different search algorithms. The user can place walls on 
the screen to see how the search algorithm reacts to it.

Slack Handles: Jay Martinez, Darr, Noah Young, Kris Martinez, Jamal Merritt

What we are going to need:
- UX/UI interface
    - Start button
    - Select the search algorithm that will be used
- 25x25 tile with ability to place/remove walls, start, and goal
- Search algorithms: breadth first search/ depth first search
- visualizing the search by coloring the tiles that have been searched in real time
- highlights the final path

Elevator Pitch:
Want a fun interactive way to learn how different search algorithms work? Well we have you covered
with our GUI python program that does just that. Be amazed at how breath first search will always 
find best path and witness the speed of depth first search but the less optimal path it finds.
If a program is going to get people excited about search algorithms it is going to be ours!

Greatest Challenge We Overcame:
The hardest part of the project was getting the GUI to communicate with the model. Since it was many of
our first time with Python and with tkinter, the GUI library, it was hard for us. In the end we were 
able to get the model to communicate with the view.

What We Learned:
It was most of our first time working with Python and we all learned a lot. Even the people who have
used Python in the past still learned something new by working with the tkinter library.
