The project idea for HackBeanpot 2023:
A program that visualizes different search algorithms. The user can place walls on 
the screen to see how the search algorithm reacts to it.

What we are going to need:
- UX/UI interface
    - Start botton
    - Select the search algorithm that will be used
- 25x25 tile with ablity to place/remove walls, start, and goal
- Search algortihms: breadth first search/ depth first search
- visualizing the search by coloring the tiles that have been searched in real time
- highlights the final path
