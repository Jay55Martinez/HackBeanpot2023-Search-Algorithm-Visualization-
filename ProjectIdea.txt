The project idea for HackBeanpot 2023:
A program that visualizes different search algorithms. The user can place walls on 
the screen to see how the search algorithm reacts to it.

Slack Handles: Jay Martinez, 

What we are going to need:
- UX/UI interface
    - Start button
    - Select the search algorithm that will be used
- 25x25 tile with ability to place/remove walls, start, and goal
- Search algorithms: breadth first search/ depth first search
- visualizing the search by coloring the tiles that have been searched in real time
- highlights the final path

Greatest Challenge We Overcame:
The hardest part of the project was getting the GUI to communicate with the model. Since it was many of
our first time with Python and with tkinter, the GUI library, it was hard for us. In the end we were 
able to get the model to communicate with the view.

What We Learned:
It was most of our first time working with Python and we all learned a lot. Even the people who have
used Python in the past still learned something new by working with the tkinter library.
